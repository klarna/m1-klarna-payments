# Klarna_Payments module

## Disclaimer
Klarna’s Magento 1 plugins for Klarna Checkout and Klarna Payments are offered as is.  With the deprecation of Magento 1 by Magento, An Adobe Company, Klarna will no longer be maintaining the Magento 1 plugins.  This includes the following:
- No feature requests for updated Klarna services will be completed
- No pull requests will be accepted
- No issues to code will be accepted
- Support requests to magento@klarna.com will receive a response in regards to the plugins no longer being supported.
Continued use of the Magento 1 plugins does not guarantee continued service with Klarna.  Klarna’s API can change over time.  Any significant vulnerabilities discovered with the Platform or the implementation of Klarna’s API may result in termination of services from Klarna.  The user of this code assumes the full risk and accepts full responsibility for maintaining their Magento 1 site along with the implementation of Klarna into their site.  This includes updating for changes to Klarna’s API as well as any security vulnerabilities which may be encountered.

Klarna recommends merchant’s to update their sites to a supported platform version (Magento 2 or re-platform).  For more information on migrating to Magento 2, visit our guide [here](https://www.klarna.com/international/business/migratingmagento/).  Klarna will continue to support our Magento 2 Klarna Payments Vendor Bundled Extension as well as the Magento 2 Klarna Checkout extension available on the Magento Marketplace.  We are committed to continue to extend the Magento 2 offering to include the latest Klarna and Magento functionality for a smoooth payment experience for merchants and their consumers.
